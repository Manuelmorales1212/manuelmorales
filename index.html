<h1>Phinshing,Flaming,and Spamming</h1>
<p>Phinshing- is to obtain to get sensitive imformation like passward, usernames, and credit card information for illegal reasons by being a trust worthy email.
Flaming- is the act of posting or sending offensive messages over the internet.
Spamming-send the same message indiscriminately to (large numbers of recipients) on the Internet

The similarities in on three words are is that there things some people use on the internet either to be annoying or for getting information that you’re not supposed to have of. The way there different is that phinshing is use to get people’s information to use it for reasons and flaming is just being a bully on the internet. And finally is spamming which is just sending multiple things over and over to the same person
